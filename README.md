Developing-Data-Products. A brief description about the Linear regression app
=============================================================================

The app Linear Regressión, is available in the link https://appsjdeaza.shinyapps.io/appjdeazaf/, with this app you can estimate a linear model using Ordinary Least Squares, you can get of this application a table with the following outcome:

- Coefficients estimated.
- Standard errors.
- T statistic.
- P-value.

You can select both dependent variable and independent variables with a simple check list. Addtionally, you get a Diagnostics Test after regression (Cook´s distance). The data that this app works is mtcars into the datasets package: http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html. If you need additional information about the app, you can sownload the presentation in the following link: http://jdeaza.github.io/Developing-Data-Products/#5.

I hope this app could be useful for you in a simple linear estimations.
